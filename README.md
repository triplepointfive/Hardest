## Hardest

Implementation of [Hardest Game Ever](www.hardestgameever.net/) base functionality written in Haskell with few levels from the original game.

Also, it's a simple engine, that shows how to use base features of SDL bindings to Haskell, including smooth keys, images, text rendering and FPS control.

Kind of proof of concept that game engines in Haskell are compact and fully intuitive.
